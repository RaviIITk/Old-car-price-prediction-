# Old-car-price-prediction-
here I used linear regression model to predict od car price with respect to different variable
Science this is my very first project so i worked on this to learn the different model creation methods and testing methods.
It involves different steps:-

Loading data

Preprocessing

Checking OLS asumption - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares

checking Multicolinearity - With the help of variance_inflation_factor https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance-inflation-factor.asp

create dummy data

create dummy data (Model Fitting)(Which includes Train_test_split method for cross vaildation, Calculating the efficiency and 

Testing

Please read this project and give suggestions, so I can Learn hoe to improve this project in the batter way
